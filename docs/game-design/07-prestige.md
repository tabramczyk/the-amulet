# 07 - Prestige System (Core Progression)

## Rules

Upon reincarnation:
1. Each skill level earned -> permanent XP bonus to that skill
2. Each job level earned -> permanent XP bonus to that job
3. Bonuses **stack across all lives**

## Formula

```
prestigeBonus = 1 + (totalLevelsAllLives * 0.01)
```

Example: 15 total Beggar levels across all lives -> 1.15x (15%) Beggar XP gain

## Effects
- Faster leveling in future lives
- Earlier access to jobs and locations
- Smoother progression curve

## What Resets
- Age (back to 16)
- All skill levels and XP
- All job levels and XP
- Current location (back to Slums)
- Money
- Story flags (some may persist - future feature)

## What Persists
- Total levels per skill (for prestige calculation)
- Total levels per job (for prestige calculation)
- Number of lives lived
- Total days lived (all lives)
